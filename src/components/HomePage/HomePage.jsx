            <p>I graduated from UofM with a graphic design major. I have done multiple graphic jobs. During my time at design jobs, I need to use html and css for editing. While learning basic coding for designers, I got interested in software development. </p>
            <p>My favorite part about the development process is seeing my ideas come to life. I love coming up with ideas, designing the UI using my graphic designer skills, and implementing it using my coding skills. I have done this with my StickyCat project, which is a full-stack application with React frontend and Python backend. </p>
            <p>Iâ€™m very excited to take on new challenges and use my coding and designing skills to make an impact. </p>
